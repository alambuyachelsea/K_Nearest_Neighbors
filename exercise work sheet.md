## Exercise 1
[x] plot the original
[x] Implement a k-NN for 1, 3, 5, 7 for 3 other microchips
[x] display a graph showing the decision boundary

## Exercise 2
[x] divide the dataset into test and training set
[x] plot the training and test in 1x2 pattern
[x] 2x3 plot showing k-NN regression & the MSE training error for k = 1,3,5,7,9,11
[x] compute and present MSE test error for k = 1,3,5,7,9,11
[ ] which k gives best regression, motivate

## Exercise 3
[X] Processes MNIST data for image recognition

## Exercise 4
[x] Repeat 1 using the KNeighborsClassifier form scikit-learn
